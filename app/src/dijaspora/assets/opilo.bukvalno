What [it was] good wine
[of that] [of night] when [we were drinking]
What [it was] good wine
[of night] when [we were happy]

[It opiated] us wine
red and white
me {they (all female) opiated} your lips
you {it opiated} my body

What [it was] warm evening
evening when [I met] you
What [it was] warm evening
when [I lost] _ self

What [it was] fondling
till life to self remembers
Oh, how [I would like]
more [one time] that [to me] [you stop by]
