[They are passing by] years,
and I still [I lie] self
that not [I live] of [of past]
and [of memory] on you

[Not one (female)] dawn not dawns,
[not one] evening not passes,
that on [to lips] [to mine]
[is not] your name

[They are dying] autumns
and I still [I dream] alone
that is still much [of love]
and [{"much"} of springs] [in front of] [to us]

Tears [they (all female) drank me up]
and I still [I cheat] nights
that [you will] once before dawn
into embrace [to me] [to come]
