The years are passing by
and I still lie to myself
that I don't live by the past
and by the memory of you

Not a single day dawns,
not a single evening passes by,
that I don't have your name
on my lips

The autumns are dying
and I still dream alone
that there is still a lot of love
and many springs in front of us

The tears have ran dry
and I still cheat the nights
that one time before the dawn
you will come to my embrace
