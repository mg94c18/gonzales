Street light
throws light in circle
While black butterflies
[they are flying] straight on her

But not [they know]
that there [it is] end
that them [he is killing]
[of her] [of light] brightness

Sometimes [I flew],
butterfly [I was] and I
Light me [she lured],
wings [to me] [fried up]

Black butterfly
flee into night,
morning await,
light [she will] [to come]
