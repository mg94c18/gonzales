This is story
which very gladly [I tell],
it is story about [to Boža] called Pub (Jack).
Some him praise, others pity,
[yet others] [they say] "Ah, my bro,
[that {male}] was rotten as hollow tooth."

[From here] then all to Budapest and to Srem on south
still tells [fairy tales] about [in him] muddy gamblers' circle,
and [they say] "[That {male}] in life [has not played] on debt!"
And everyone self [they agree] how today [there are no] [of such] like Boža Pub.

Somewhere [he had] estate,
that self [it knew] more less,
although about that [he didn't talk] neither for medicine.
[He needed] [to be] vet,
but [he pursued] certain 'inat' (see track 15),
so [he lived] from gambling whole lifetime.

Oh, [that {male}] [he followed] cards [as if] sees through them,
and always cold like špricer, always dangerously quiet,
and only when [chases away] [bad luck] [he would say] rhyme;
and everyone still [they remember] words [with which] [bad luck] [chases away] Boža called Pub:

"[In vain] [to you] money,
my nephews,
[in vain] [to you] [it was] [of good] [of will].
And looks hard,
sticky fingers,
I still [I cheat] little better.
[Yep, I do...]
And card is whore, excuse me for [I swear],
because I only [I talk] [that way] how [I hear],
and if [they lied] me and I [I lie] you.
That story knows everyone from devil to priest,
because [lot of] [rowdies have ended up] bankrupt,
and gambler self hides and crouches in each of us,
and waits right moment."

Once self [he played cards]
with [with some] Russian emigrant,
that [he was] usurer rich as [grand duke].
[He played] and manager [of post office]
called Ljupče of endearment
and some smuggler whom [he was chasing] whole county.

Wow, that [was a game], still self talks about her,
kibitzers in [in trans], cold [breaks through] sweat,
on [on table] pile [of money], [not to] [I mention] number...
And [he pulled] queen on eighteen dead cold Boža Pub.

And [do you know] for that
when [he has] with [with certain] [with baron]
[he played] four days?  That [he was] war!
[They were going] him constantly cards strong,
so [he took away] and carriage,
black horse, [cigarette case], staff and watch.

Baron [he talked] afterwards that [deck was old],
that [he was drinking too much], that him [he carried away] passion,
well everyone that [they lose] self [they angry], that is known thing.
And everybody loses [at least] sometimes but never Boža called Pub.

...

From womanizer's side
[he wasn't falling into] in Tarzans,
but far from that that [he was] rabbit.
[He had] [some {females}] here and there,
but everyone very well [we know]
that at women plays some fifth ace.

Love is game in which often [doesn't work] bluff,
heart self opens harder than [best (male)] safe,
[he had] he self's ladies: diamond, spade, heart and club,
and [he was faithful to them] all to destined day Boža called Pub.

Gentlemen dear,
[he disappeared] without [of trace],
and that [to whole] [to story] gives strange tone.
[Some {males}] self jumbos [they were swearing]
that [they have] at Sombor [they met]
some guy that [he was] identical him.

Maybe him [she took away] card [all the way] in Prague or Vienna,
already [for a long time] nobody about him [he didn't hear] neither word,
[does he still hang on] on world or [he surrendered] match
[and then] with [with angels] on top [of skies] plays raub, preferans and ajnc.
