In Baƒçka Palanka there was a dance party,
hm, I lied; an ordinary drunken party,
we were just playing off-key as we were getting older,
we were having worse and worse gigs,
afterwards we were regretting, we were supposedly very surprised
what {bottom} we reached and next to what crocodiles we were waking up.

A little before the closing time, a big guy approached me
with those Hitler-like moustache,
a seal ring, a loose tie,
to tip us, thrilled with the party,
but I am really not a fan of those aggressive fags
who always chase after the waitresses and smell of aftershave.
But, fine, I guess...

I was tired.  I said to that peacock:
"Boss, I'm in a knock-down,
I'm scratching {these} strings, I play tambura for days {now},
the smoke in the restaurants is killing me,
now, look, there is a draft under this tent..."
He said: "Wait a moment, you were on good terms with my old {woman}!"

If it isn't ...!
Yeah, only then did I recognize him.
Well, it's no wonder, a whole life passed.
That sleazy guy is the one that Buba Erdeljan married...

Why the heck did you do it?
my little mouse,
to marry such a punk?
Why weren't you careful?
Why did you turn a prince
into this frog?
I would like to know - If only I could know
You were a daddy's girl,
I {was} a tramp,
a silly guy with hay in {his} hear
Take {it} or leave {it},
Who could have guessed?
The hell with it.

The guy said: "I'm here with two nice ladies."
Ugh, two wicked loose women...
He winked like a womanizer: "We all fool around a little..."
I winked too, like: "Of course..."
And so I sat with him and those bimbos
And he was just babbling on.
Oh, did he kiss her with those lips?
Oh no!

Waiter, why are you sauntering?
Are you too maybe on strike?
Hand over a two liter bottle, kiddo, play some music,
and we'll be fine.

I have been to north and south,
across and around,
and what did I keep longing for?
Well not for much, really,
for an ivy from one tall wall
and for Buba Erdeljan.

I would really like to know,
why the heck did you do it?
my beauty?
Oh, you were precious as gold.
Why did you allow
this guy here to use you up?
You fool...

Oh, my old crush...
