A street light
throws light around
While black butterflies
fly straight towards her

But they don't know
that there's the end
that the brightness of her
light is killing them

Sometime {ago} I flew,
I, too, was a butterfly
Light lured me,
fried up my wings

{Hey} black butterfly
flee into the night,
await the morning,
the light will come
