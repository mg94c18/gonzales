All gates open
Only ours [is not]
[She heard] grandmother that [you are coming],
[She heard] so me [she hides]

Peacefully sleep grandmother
Everything [it is] locked
My heart [is not]
[In vain] [to you] gates

All [they are] lamps [put out]
Only ours [is not]
[She heard] grandmother that [you are coming],
[She heard] so me [she hides]

All [they are] roses blossomed
Only ours [are not]
That them darling [during the night] [he's stepping on]
[To me] while [he's coming]
